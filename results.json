Office hours begin at 3 pm so you have time to prepare for classes and grade homework. Joy provides a full curriculum and teaching plan. The co-workers are nice and the working environment is a good one. Shihu is a great place to save money. We say this is a town in the countryside, but it is more like a small city with farms nearby. Eveything you might need you can find in town, unless you want exciting nightlife or many Western style restaurants. These can be found in Tauchung City (a forty minute bus-ride away). Shihu is close to Lukang Historic area and Sun Moon Lake, both very popular travel destinations. You will share the 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom high-rise apartment with another foreign teacher. It comes fully furnished and with all bedding and appliances. The only costs for you are water and electricity, but this is very little compared to Western countries. Upon request, we will provide you with the email for our foreign teacher of three years, as well as pictures of the apartment. What do WE want? We want energetic, fun teachers our students can love! We hope to hear from you!\nLet us know when you can fly to Taiwan and start working.\nPlease contact Jully by email: jully8850300@gmail.com\nor Nina by email : e1214n@yahoo.com.tw\n"
